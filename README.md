CSS-Styler
==========

CSStyler is a little app for writing fast CSS structures. Just type your selector and press 'enter', for child selectors just press space. This version needs some correcting, for example if you write more spaces than expected, the app will crash. If you want to contribute thats great! This app is useful for companies that don't use preprocessors yet.
